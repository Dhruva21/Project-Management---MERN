# Project-Management---MERN

- This application has functionalities to add client information and project information.
- All the information about the project and client are displayed on the front-page of the application. Used bootstrap classes for styling.
- For the frontend part, I used ReactJs. Also used apollo-client dependency from react in-order to write queries to the graphql endpoint.
- For the server-side, I used graphQl language.
- Database used for this project: MongoDB
